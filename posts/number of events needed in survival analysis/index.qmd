```{r, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = T)
```

```{r}
library(gsDesign)
rm(list = ls())
```

using the `nEvents` function from gsDesign to calculate the number of events

```{r}
(nE <- nEvents(hr = 0.6, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.2))
```

the $log(HR)$ under null distribution\~$N(0, \frac{1}{d_1} + \frac{1}{d_2})$. To control for the type 1 error no more than one sided 0.025, we could derived the critical value for significance test.

The variance of $log(HR)=\frac{1}{d_1} + \frac{1}{d_2}$ was derived based on exponential distribution, using the maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameter:

First, considering one treatment setting $$Likelihood=\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(t)^{\delta_i}S(t)^{1-\delta_i}$$ where n is size all subjects; if the subject occur event, then $\delta_i=1$; f(t) is the probability density function of survival time, and S(t) is the survival function.

```{r}
d <- nE
z_cut <- qnorm(
  p = 1 - 0.975,
  mean = 0,
  sd = sqrt(4 / d)
)
z_cut
```

Under the alternative hyperthesis, the $log(HR)$ obeys distribution of $N(log(hr), \frac{1}{d_1} + \frac{1}{d_2})$. Here we also used the standard distribution under null hyperthesis as other statistic software (e.g, EAST).

```{r}
pnorm(
  q = z_cut,
  mean = log(0.6),
  sd = sqrt(4 / d)
)
```

The variance of log(hr) $\frac{1}{d_1} + \frac{1}{d_2}$ could also be expressed:

$$\frac{1}{r(1-r)D}$$ where D is the total number events of control and active treatments, r is the event proportion from control treatment.

```{r}
# control / event
(nE <- nEvents(hr = 1.4, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.2, ratio = 0.5))
```

```{r}
d <- nE
r <- 1 / 3
sd <- sqrt(1 / (r * (1 - r) * d))

z_cut <- qnorm(
  p = 0.975,
  mean = 0,
  sd = sd
)
z_cut
```

```{r}
1 - pnorm(
  q = z_cut,
  mean = log(1.4),
  sd = sd
)
```
